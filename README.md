# 🏠 Intelligent Property Price Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning-based real estate analytics system that predicts property prices using historical housing data.

The system allows users to input property features such as area, number of rooms, amenities, and furnishing status, and returns:

- 💰 Predicted property price  
- 📊 Best performing ML model used for prediction  

This project fulfills the requirements of **Milestone 1: ML-Based Property Price Prediction**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Real estate pricing depends on multiple factors such as:

- Property size
- Location accessibility
- Amenities
- Furnishing status
- Number of rooms and bathrooms

Manually estimating property value can be inaccurate and subjective.  

This system uses supervised machine learning models to predict property prices based on structured historical data.
